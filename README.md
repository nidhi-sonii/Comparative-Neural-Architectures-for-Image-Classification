## Comparative Performance Analysis of Neural Network Architectures for Image Classification


# This project evaluates and compares multiple deep learning architectures for supervised image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
# The models studied include:

# Baseline CNN

# CNN with Batch Normalization & Dropout

# ResNet-18

# ResNet-34

# DenseNet-121

# The goal is to analyze how architectural depth, feature connectivity, and regularization techniques affect performance, generalization, and efficiency in small-scale image classification tasks.
